                chapter:"It was just another quiet morning in Ajegunle when Timi stumbled across the book. Dusty and forgotten, it lay hidden in the back of his grandfather’s wooden chest. Its leather cover was cracked with age, and a faded symbol—a triangle with a circle inside—was burned into the front. <br><br>Timi flipped it open and gasped. The pages shimmered faintly, as if alive. Strange symbols danced before his eyes, shifting like smoke. He didn’t know it yet, but he had found the lost Codex of Amun, a legendary book written by ancient alchemists.<br><br>And Timi had just become its new keeper. Timi had always been curious.In his grandfather’s house—an old bungalow tucked away in the dusty corner of Ajegunle—there was a rule: never open the chest at the foot of the bed. But Grandfather was in the hospital now, and the house was silent. Too silent.Timi couldn’t resist.The chest creaked open like it hadn’t been touched in years. Inside, under old newspapers and a faded agbada, he found it—a thick book bound in dark leather, warm to the touch even in the cool harmattan morning.On the cover was a strange symbol: a triangle, a circle inside it, and three dots. <br><br>It pulsed faintly as if it had a heartbeat.Timi opened it—and time seemed to pause. Symbols he’d never seen before shimmered on the pages, yet somehow, his mind understood them. The room darkened. The candle flickered blue.He slammed the book shut, breathing hard.That was the moment his life changed."

                topic:"The Golden Dust",
                chapter:"Later that night, Timi lit a candle and began to read. As he traced one of the alchemy symbols with his finger, a soft hum filled the room. The book glowed—and a tiny burst of golden dust floated into the air. Timi coughed, stumbled back, and watched in disbelief as his pencil on the table turned into pure gold. <br><br> He stared, heart pounding. “This is real?” <br><br> But with great power came warnings. The book’s next page read in bold letters: “To create is divine. To destroy is easy. Balance must be kept.” <br><br> Someone—or something—was watching. Timi couldn’t sleep.The book sat on his table like it was calling him. When he opened it again, the first page glowed softly, then words formed in the center:“Alchemy: the science of transformation. To change matter. To touch the divine.”He ran his finger along a diagram that showed a cube turning into a sphere. A light shot from the page. A soft pop. He jumped back.His wooden pencil had turned… into solid gold.He reached out with shaking hands. “Oh… my… God.”The next page turned by itself. This one was different. <br><br>There were warnings written in deep red ink:“For every transformation, there is a price. Use wisely.”Suddenly, a gust of wind blew through the room—despite the closed window. The candle went out.Something had been awakened."

                topic:"The Teacher Appears",
                chapter:"The next day, Timi was followed. A man in a long, dark robe approached him in the market. He introduced himself as Master Elion, the last true alchemist in Lagos. He had sensed the Codex’s awakening.<br><br> “I can help you,” Elion said. “But the more you use the book, the more it attracts darkness.”<br><br>Timi was skeptical, but after a demonstration—where Elion turned water into steam using just a word—he agreed. The training began that night in an abandoned warehouse under the Third Mainland Bridge.And so did the tests. <br><br>The next morning, Timi’s world felt different. People in the street moved slower, sounds felt sharper, like he was tuned to something new.He was walking through the market when he felt a chill. A tall man in dark native attire stood near a stall, watching him. The man’s eyes were gold.     “You opened the book,” he said softly.Timi froze. “How did you—?”“I am Elion.<br><br> I’ve been waiting for the Codex to choose its next bearer. It chose you.”That evening,  Elion brought Timi to an abandoned warehouse by the lagoon. There, with chalk and symbols on the floor, he revealed truths: that alchemists once walked Nigeria, blending ancient science with spiritual energy. But their knowledge was hidden, lost… until now.“You’ve inherited a power some would kill for,” Elion warned. “Your training starts now.”"

                topic:"The Fire Trial",
                chapter:"Elion drew a circle on the floor, inscribed with ancient runes. “If you truly want to become an alchemist, you must face the Fire Trial.”<br><br>Timi stood in the circle. Flames burst up around him—but they didn’t burn. They tested his emotions, his memories, his fears. He saw his late mother’s face, heard her voice urging him on.When it ended, he stood shaken—but changed.Elion smiled. “You passed. But there are other forces now aware of you. <br><br>Be ready.” Before Timi could truly learn alchemy, he had to face his first trial.Elion drew a glowing circle on the floor and motioned him in. “The Fire Trial reveals your heart.”The moment Timi stepped in, flames rose all around him. But they didn’t burn—they whispered.      He saw his mother’s face—the day she died. He saw himself as a small boy, alone. Then he saw his fears: of failure, of losing control, of the book corrupting him.He dropped to his knees, breathing fast. “I can’t do this…” <br><br>But then, through the flame, his mother’s voice came: “You were born for more.”He stood up.The fire died down. The circle dimmed.Elion looked at him with new respect. “You didn’t run. You faced your truth.”Timi had passed."

                topic:" The Shadow Alchemist",
                chapter:"That night, something broke into Elion’s hideout. Books flew. Candles went out. In the chaos, a masked figure stepped forward—cloaked in black mist, with red-glowing eyes.“I’ve come for the boy.”Elion stood protectively in front of Timi. “He’s not ready.”“He doesn’t have to be,” the figure hissed. <br><br>“The Codex belongs to the Order now.”And just like that, a new enemy revealed itself: The Shadow Alchemist, once a powerful alchemist like Elion, now twisted by dark energy.Timi’s real journey was just beginning. That night, as they studied the Codex in the warehouse, the room grew cold. The lights flickered. The air turned heavy.Elion stood. <br><br> “We’re not alone.”Suddenly, the windows shattered. Out of the darkness stepped a man—or something like a man—wearing black robes, his face covered by a silver mask. Red energy crackled around him.“Elion,” the figure hissed. “Still playing mentor, I see.” “Elazar,” Elion muttered. “I thought you were dead.” “Far from it. The Codex is mine. The boy—he belongs to the Order now.”Timi stood frozen. The Shadow Alchemist's energy was suffocating.Elion stepped in front of him.<br><br> “You’ll have to go through me.”And just like that, a battle of pure energy erupted—light versus shadow, old magic against corrupted power. In the chaos, Timi grabbed the Codex and ran.Because he knew now—this wasn’t just about magic.It was about survival."
