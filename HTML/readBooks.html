                chapter:" The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden hue over Lekki, a bustling town known for its vibrant culture and lively streets. As the clock struck six, the sounds of vendors calling out their wares mixed with the laughter of children playing football on the narrow streets. Among the crowd, a new face stood outMr. Adebayo, the newly appointed headmaster of Lekki Primary School. Mr. Adebayo stepped off the danfo bus, his heart racing with anticipation. After years of teaching in various schools across the country, he had finally landed a position in Lekki, a place he had heard so much about. He was determined to make a difference, to inspire the next generation of leaders. Clutching his briefcase, he took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of the sea mingled with the spicy aroma of street food. As he walked toward the school, he couldn't help but notice the colorful murals that adorned the walls of the buildings. Each one told a story of the community—the struggles, the triumphs, and the rich heritage of the people who called Lekki home. <br> Mr. Adebayo was captivated. This was more than just a job; it was an opportunity to be part of something greater. Arriving at Lekki Primary School, he was greeted by the sight of eager children playing in the schoolyard. Their laughter echoed through the air, a sweet melody that filled him with hope. The school building stood tall, its walls worn but sturdy, bearing the marks of years of learning and growth. He knew that within those walls lay untapped potential, waiting to be nurtured.As he entered the school, Mr. Adebayo was met by the secretary, Mrs. Oluwaseun, who welcomed him with a warm smile. “We’re so glad to have you, sir! The staff has been looking forward to your arrival.” Her enthusiasm was infectious, and he felt a surge of confidence.<br> As the meeting concluded, Mr. Adebayo felt a mixture of excitement and trepidation. He knew that change would not come easily, but he was ready to face the challenges ahead.<br> With determination in his heart, he stepped out into the playground, ready to meet his students for the first time.“Good afternoon, everyone!” he called out, his voice steady and confident. The children turned to him, their curious faces lighting up with interest. “I’m Mr. Adebayo, your new headmaster, and I’m here to help you all learn and grow.”The response was immediate—a chorus of cheerful greetings filled the air, and he felt a wave of warmth wash over him. In that moment, he knew he had made the right choice in coming to Lekki.<br> This was just the beginning of his journey, and he was excited to see where it would lead.As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the school, Mr. Adebayo took a moment to reflect on his first day. He understood that the road ahead would be filled with obstacles, but he was ready to tackle them head-on. With a renewed sense of purpose, he smiled, knowing that together with his students and teachers, they could build a brighter future for Lekki Primary School."

                topic:"The Dust",
                chapter:"Ade sat at the back of the class, arms folded across his chest, eyes fixed on the new headmaster who stood in front of the chalkboard. The other students whispered excitedly about the man in the crisp shirt and polished shoes, but Ade wasn’t impressed. In his thirteen years, he had seen headmasters come and go—each one with big promises and strict rules, but never lasting long enough to make a real difference.<br> <br>Mr. Adebayo noticed him immediately. Not because Ade caused trouble, but because he didn’t. While the others laughed and responded to questions, Ade stayed quiet, watching, measuring. There was something about his silence that carried weight—like he had seen more than a child should.“Ade,” Mr. Adebayo called gently. “Would you read the next paragraph, please?”The classroom went quiet. Ade hesitated, then stood up slowly. He spoke clearly, reading the words with confidence. His voice wasn’t loud, but it held a quiet power that made everyone listen.When he finished, Mr. Adebayo smiled. “Well done, Ade. You read beautifully.”It wasn’t praise Ade was used to, and for a brief second, a flicker of surprise crossed his face. He nodded slightly and sat back down.Later that day, during break time, Mr. Adebayo spotted Ade sitting alone under the mango tree near the school fence.<br><br> While most students played football or swapped snacks, Ade pulled a small, worn-out book from his bag and began to read.Mr. Adebayo walked over and sat beside him. “What are you reading?”Ade glanced at the book cover. “Things Fall Apart, sir.” “A classic,” Mr. Adebayo said with a grin. “Do you like it?”Ade shrugged. “It’s okay. I like how strong Okonkwo is.”Mr. Adebayo nodded. “Okonkwo is strong, yes—but sometimes, strength isn’t just about muscles. Sometimes, it’s about choosing the right path, even when it’s the harder one.”Ade looked up at him, curiosity flickering in his eyes.“You remind me of someone I knew,”<br><br> Mr. Adebayo continued. “Smart, quiet. Always reading. He didn’t talk much, but when he did, people listened.”“What happened to him?” Ade asked.“He became a teacher,” Mr. Adebayo said, smiling. “And eventually, a headmaster.”Ade smiled a little, then quickly hid it behind his book.That moment, small as it was, planted a seed. Mr. Adebayo knew it would take time, but he was beginning to understand that Ade was special—sharp, thoughtful, and full of potential. All he needed was someone who believed in him.And Mr. Adebayo had made up his mind: he would be that person."

                topic:"The Journey",
                chapter:"It was barely past sunrise when the school bell rang differently—short and urgent, not the usual morning rhythm. The students gathered in scattered clusters, whispering and wondering why assembly hadn’t started.Mrs. Oluwaseun stood at the front of the school compound, fidgeting with the clipboard in her hands. A few minutes later, she cleared her throat and made the announcement: “Mr. Adebayo has travelled.<br><br> He was called away on an urgent family matter and will return in a few days.”The words hung heavy in the air. No one had expected it—not the teachers, not the pupils, and certainly not Ade, who stood by the mango tree, eyes fixed on the empty office window.The headmaster’s absence created a strange shift in the school. The teachers tried their best to maintain order, but things weren’t the same. Students talked louder. Lessons started late. Some even skipped class altogether.But not Ade.For the first time, he sat in the front row, reading ahead in his English textbook and even helping the younger students with their handwriting.<br><br> Something had changed in him, something subtle but strong. Mr. Adebayo’s words from before still echoed in his mind—“Sometimes, strength is about choosing the right path, even when it’s the harder one.”Meanwhile, far from Lekki, Mr. Adebayo sat in the back of a keke napep in his hometown, Ijebu Ode.<br> His younger sister was ill, and he had come to support the family. But even as he sat beside her hospital bed, his mind drifted back to the school—to the classroom, the laughter, the lessons, and that boy named Ade, whose quiet strength had reminded him why he became a teacher.On the third day, after confirming his sister was stable, Mr. Adebayo packed his bag and prepared to return. As he boarded the bus back to Lekki, his heart beat with anticipation.<br><br> He had missed his students. Missed the energy of the school. And somewhere deep inside, he wondered if they had missed him too.Back in school, a commotion stirred by the front gate. Students dropped their bags, and teachers peeked from their classrooms. The green danfo bus stopped, and out stepped Mr. Adebayo, suitcase in one hand and a warm smile on his face.Ade stood still for a second, then walked over and said simply, “Welcome back, sir.”And in that moment, Mr. Adebayo knew—he wasn’t just running a school anymore. He was building a family."
